# _Class Recommender_

#### By _**Jonathan Cheng**_

#### _A website for recommending a class to play on Elden Ring based on user responses._

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- JQuery

## Description

_This browser application first asks for the user's age. It then branches to allow or disallow use of site depending on age entered (17 or older = allow). The user answers a questionnaire, which then recommends a class for the game Elden Ring based on their responses._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- _Clone this repository to your desktop._
- _Navigate to the top level of the directory._
- _Open course-recommendation.html with your browser._

## Known Bugs

- _Background color of welcome page does not fill the whole page from top to bottom._
- _"Enter your age" box should be placed at the center of the page, rather than towards the top._
- _Questionnaire does not currently provide an accurate recommendation of classes. It's completed so that project requirements are met._
